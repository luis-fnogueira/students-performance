# students-performance
EDA with Kaggle's dataset about students performance.

The main goal of this study is to understand how this dataset is distributed, see what is in it.

First looking at the grades (which are the quantitative variables) one can see that the grades are relatively similar among them. There is no big difference when we look at the quartiles and medians.
What brings attention in this first glance is that we have only a zero grade in math, it can be just an outlier, but it could be a point of attention.

This dataset has 1000 rows duly filled

### Math scores

As seen earlier, math has the lowest grades compared to the other matters. Besides the low outliers, the distribution seems normal.

### Reading scores

Reading scores distribution also seems normal.

### Writing scores

And lastly the distribution of writing scores also seems normal. In a way, all scores are similar to each other.

### Correlation

Those three variables have a strong positive correlation, mainly writing and reading.

### Proportion by sex

In this dataset we have almost a division of 50/50 by sex. We have a little bit more men in the research.

### Parental level of education

Student's parents have "some college" and "associate degree". 

### Lunch

The majority of students prefer the standart lunch.

Most students are of Race C and the less represented group is Race A
